# Vision-Transformer
A simple Vision Transformer (VIT) implementation for image classification tasks. This repo showcases the ViT architecture, using attention to process image patches. It includes model training, evaluation, and performance analysis, aimed at understanding ViT‚Äôs application in computer vision.

# Dataset
- Execute dataset.py to download the Data 
#### 1. **im\_Metaplastic** 
    : These are changing cells that are **not cancer**, but appear during normal repair or transformation, They're important because cancer often starts in these areas.
    : Not dangerous by themselves, but need to be watched.

#### 2. **im\_Dyskeratotic**

    : These are **abnormal-looking cells that may be a sign of pre-cancer or cancer, they show early signs of damage.
* These are **warning signs** and should be looked at carefully.

#### 3. **im\_Superficial-Intermediate**

    : These are normal, healthy cells** from the outer layer of the cervix, Their presence usually means everything is fine.

#### 4. **im\_Parabasal**

    : These are **immature cells** that are deeper in the tissue, If you see a lot of them, it could mean the tissue is healing or there's a hormonal issue, especially after menopause.
    : Not cancer, but can show other changes.

### 5. **im\_Koilocytotic**

    : These cells show **HPV infection**, which is the virus that can lead to cervical cancer, These are early warning cells ‚Äî not cancer, but they tell doctors to keep an eye out.

| Cell Type                | What it Means             | Is it Dangerous?         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Metaplastic              | Changing but not cancer   | Usually not              |
| Dyskeratotic             | Damaged, possibly serious | Yes, watch closely       |
| Superficial-Intermediate | Normal healthy cells      | No                       |
| Parabasal                | Immature, often harmless  | Sometimes                |
| Koilocytotic             | HPV-infected cells        | Can lead to cancer later |


## Patch Embedding
Image is splitted into blocks of m * n, and then each patch is seperated, Those patches are then feed forwarded to 
Neural Network to get its embedding. All channels(R, G, B) of the patches are stacked together 1 after the other.

[Pixel1r, Pixel1g, Pixel1b, Pixel2r, Pixel2g, Pixel2b, ....]

The Fully Connected Neural Network outputs Number of Patches * D ; where D is the dimension of  Attention. Now we have embedding of all the patches, hence we have to infuse it with Positional Embedding. At position 0 we add CLS token and rest places we add those to positional embedding using Sinusodial Formula.
So, basically what Patch Embedding does is
    - seperates the images into patches
    - add positional embedding
    - add CLS token at the begining (for SUmmary of the Task)



#  Vision Transformer for Cervical Cancer Detection

This project presents a **simple yet powerful implementation of Vision Transformers (ViT)** for image classification in the medical domain ‚Äî specifically for detecting and classifying various cervical cell types. By leveraging the power of self-attention, this model is capable of learning meaningful patterns from cell images for early and accurate diagnosis.

## üìÅ Dataset

To download and prepare the dataset, simply run:

```bash
python dataset.py
````

The dataset includes five different classes of cervical cells, each with clinical significance:

| Cell Type                    | Description                                              | Is it Dangerous?         |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Metaplastic**              | Changing cells; not cancerous but can be precursors.     | Usually not              |
| **Dyskeratotic**             | Abnormal cells; may be signs of pre-cancer or cancer.    | Yes, watch closely       |
| **Superficial-Intermediate** | Normal, healthy cells from cervix surface.               | No                       |
| **Parabasal**                | Immature cells, seen during healing or hormonal changes. | Sometimes                |
| **Koilocytotic**             | HPV-infected cells; early indicators of possible cancer. | Can lead to cancer later |

Each image corresponds to one of the above categories and represents a specific stage or condition relevant to cervical health.

## üß© Patch Embedding

The Vision Transformer processes images in **patches**, not pixels. Here's how it works:

1. **Patch Creation**: Images are divided into fixed-size blocks (patches), e.g. 16x16.
2. **Flatten & Stack**: Each patch‚Äôs RGB values are flattened into a 1D vector:

   ```
   [Pixel1r, Pixel1g, Pixel1b, Pixel2r, Pixel2g, Pixel2b, ...]
   ```
3. **Linear Projection**: A fully connected layer projects each patch into a D-dimensional embedding space.
4. **Positional Embedding**: Positional information is added using sinusoidal or learned embeddings.
5. **CLS Token**: A `[CLS]` token is prepended to represent the summary for classification.

The output is a sequence of embeddings:

```
[CLS, Patch1, Patch2, ..., PatchN]
```

which is then passed through Transformer encoders.
